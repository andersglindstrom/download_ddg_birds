I recently tried the first notebook for the fast.ai course. This is the notebook:

  * https://github.com/fastai/course22/blob/master/00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb

It didn't work. `search_images` failed with an HTTP error code 403.

I found this page that described how to download DuckDuckGo images:

  * https://www.kaggle.com/code/patriciabrezeanu/how-to-create-an-images-dataset-with-duckduckgo

There is a [Jupyter notebook](README.md) in this repo that shows how to fix the failing part of the 'Is it a bird' notebook.
